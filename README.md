# DEV.to-clone

> An DEV.to clone created with AdonisJS, SQLite and Vue.js 3

## Motivation:
I started to work on this project to learn the AdonisJS framework that [Wezeo](https://wezeo.com/), the company I'd like to work for one day, is switching to. I also want to learn how to use Typescript while working on the project, write unit tests using Vitest, and use Pinia instead of Vuex for state management.
